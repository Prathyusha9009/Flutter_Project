🧠 Project Title: MindNest — Grow, Recall, Test
📘 Project Summary

MindNest is a multi-module educational Flutter application designed to help students learn, revise, and test their knowledge in an engaging way.
The app integrates three learning tools into one cohesive platform:

🌳 TopicTree – An expandable, tree-structured view of subjects, chapters, and topics.
Helps students navigate through concepts in a visual and organized manner.
Implements recursive widgets (ExpansionTile) for hierarchical display.

🃏 FocusCards – A flashcard-based revision system.
Encourages quick recall of definitions and key points.
Allows interactive flipping of cards with smooth animations.

🧩 QuizTrail – A quiz-based module for knowledge testing.
Presents multiple-choice questions dynamically.
Displays a scoreboard and animated completion message.
Each module emphasizes simplicity, reusability, and an intuitive user experience built entirely using Flutter’s widget framework — no external packages required.

🎨 Key Features
Attractive UI with gradient backgrounds, rounded buttons, and smooth transitions.
Modular navigation using Navigator.push() for seamless movement between tools.
Fully responsive design (works on both mobile and web).
Clean, readable code structure — suitable for lab demonstration and extension.

💡 Learning Outcomes
Practical understanding of Flutter layouts, navigation, and widget composition.
Implementation of state management and reusable UI components.
Experience in combining multiple modules into one Flutter app.
Application of educational app design principles in real-world development.

📈 Project Impact

MindNest transforms how students interact with study materials by blending structure (TopicTree), revision (FocusCards), and evaluation (QuizTrail) into one cohesive ecosystem — encouraging active recall, progressive learning, and self-assessment.
